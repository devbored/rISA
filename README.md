# ricestick
A simple yet full-featured computer system, using a custom RISC-V core, meant for implementation on a Lattice iCEstick FPGA development board. The goal for this project is to design the whole computing system stack from scratch.

*The project is loosely-based off of [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor)*.

## Project features
- The RISC-V core design for both physical (**RiTL**) and software-emulated (**RiEMU**) implementations
- **RiOS**, a very basic operating system for the ricestick
- Various utilities such as an Assembler, C compiler, and a few others

## RiTL
RTL design for the ricestick project written in synthesizable Verilog.

## RiEMU
An x86-based emulated implementaion of the ricestick project.

## RiOS
A minimal operating system for the ricestick project.

## Build instructions
*TODO: Implement this laterâ€¦*
