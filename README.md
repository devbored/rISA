# ricestick
A simple yet full-featured computer system, using a custom RISC-V core, meant for implementation on a **Lattice iCEstick FPGA development board**. The goal for this project is to design the whole computing system stack from scratch.

*The project is loosely-based off of [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor)*.

## Project features
- The RISC-V core design for both physical (**RiTL**) and software-emulated (**RiEMU**) implementations
- Assembler and C compiler
- **RiOS**, a very basic operating system for the ricestick

## RiTL features
- *TODO: Implement this later...*

## REMU features
- *TODO: Implement this later...*

## RiOS features
- *TODO: Implement this later...*

## Build instructions
*TODO: Implement this laterâ€¦*
